Ideal gas flow example is LAMMPS example of flow of SDPD particles across a pillar of SDPD particles. Particles of the pillar are fixed, and other particles experience a forcing. Interactions between all particles are calculated using the data-driven particle dynamics model. Additionally, there is an additional soft potential between the pillar particles and the non pillar particles.

Star polymer example is LAMMPS example of using the data-driven particle dynamics model trained on the star polymer 11 dataset. It is a periodic box of particles representative of star polymers.
